                <h2>Breakfast: Van-Ness UDC</h2>
                <p>
                    Walk north on Connecticut Avenue for 0.25 miles to <a href="https://breadfurst.com/" target="_blank">Bread Furst</a>, founded by Mark Furstenberg, 86, a longtime Washingtonian who received a James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker in 2017. Bread Furst bakes handcrafted breads, pastries, and other baked goods made with high-quality ingredients. “Some 800 baguettes a day fly out of the bakery on weekends” according to the Washington Post. 
                </p>

                <h2>Morning: Woodley Park-Zoo</h2>
                <p>
                    Giant Pandas returned to Washington DC in October when Bao Li [BOW-lee] and Qing Bao [ching-BOW] traveled from China aboard a dedicated “FedEx Panda Express” Boeing 777F aircraft. They are not scheduled to make their Zoo debut until January 24 but there are more than 1,500 animals to admire in the meantime. The National Zoo is free and there are plenty of indoor spaces to warm up on a cold day. Walk North on Connecticut Avenue for 0.25 to the main entrance
                </p>

                <h2>Lunch: Gallery Place Chinatown</h2>
                <p>
                    Spanish-American chef Jose Andres is celebrated for his culinary achievements and  his extensive humanitarian work. His non-profit organization, World Central Kitchen (WCK), has provided millions of meals to people in disaster-stricken areas worldwide. His relief efforts include responses to major hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the U.S., as well as feeding refugees and displaced individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine and Gaza. Try some small plates from the man with a big heart at Jaleo or Zaytina, both located a few blocks from the Metro station. 
                </p>

                <h2>Afternoon: NoMa Gallaudet-U</h2>
                <p>
                    Union Market, a food hall and marketplace located [XXX] from the NoMa Metro center originally opened as a wholesale market in the 1930s. It was revitalized and reopened in 2012, evolving into a contemporary food and community hub. It is known for supporting small businesses, local farmers, and up-and-coming chefs. In addition to food, the market features unique retail shops selling locally made products, home goods, and crafts.  Check out the witching hour candle from Salt and Sundry, hand crafted knives from District Cutlery or look into renting a plant from Jungle and Loom.
                </p>

                <h2>Dinner: Silver Spring</h2>
                <p>
                    More Ethiopians live in the Washington, D.C., region than any other urban area outside of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank. Historically, most Ethiopian immigrants lived in the District, but more recently Downtown Silver Spring has become a “little Ethiopia” filled with Ethiopian and Eritrean-owned restaurants, coffee stores, markets, and nightclubs. You can find some of them by walking east on Wayne Avenue and making a right on Georgia Avenue. Grab dinner at Lucy, Lasaac, Abol, or Betseb. Afterwards, head over to the Quarry House Tavern, a local institution since 1936 with a laid back vibe and a vast beer menu.
