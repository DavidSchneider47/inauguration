                <h2>Dinner: Silver Spring</h2>
                <p>
                    More Ethiopians live in the Washington, D.C., region than any other urban area outside of Addis Ababa, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank. Historically, most Ethiopian immigrants lived in the District, but more recently Downtown Silver Spring has become a “little Ethiopia” filled with Ethiopian and Eritrean-owned restaurants, coffee stores, markets, and nightclubs. From the station, head east on Wayne Avenue, cross Georgia Avenue and walk south to grab dinner at<a href="https://www.langanorestaurants.com/" target="_blank">Langano </a> or <a href="https://www.betesebrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Betesub </a>.

        <h2>Breakfast: Takoma</h2>
        <p>
            Beginning in the 1970s, DC became a major hub for the American punk rock scene, known for its distinctive sound, DIY ethos, and political activism. These days when some punk rockers aren’t performing or rehearsing, you can find them baking treats at <a href="https://www.donutrundc.com/" target="_blank">Donut Run </a>. Walk under the railroad overpass and down 4th Street to the brightly lit, pink building for vegan donuts that come in classic flavors, like chocolate glazed and cinnamon sugar, but also non-traditional flavors, such as matcha, french toast, and mango coconut.
        </p>

        <h2>Morning: NoMa Gallaudet-U</h2>

Then visit the <a href="https://nmwa.org/" target="_blank">National Museum of Women in the Arts </a>, which is dedicated to celebrating the achievements of women artists.

        <p>
             <a href="https://www.bethesdarow.com/" target="_blank">Bethesda Row </a>was developed in the 1990s in order to create a mixed-use area that embraced both the convenience of the suburbs and the vibrancy of an urban environment.

    <p>
        Take the New Jersey Avenue exit and then walk south to Yards Park.

    </p>

    <h2>Dinner: U Street</h2>
    <p>
        In the early 20th century, U Street was the center of African American culture and nightlife in Washington, DC, earning the nickname “Black Broadway”. It was home to some of the most famous Black-owned businesses, theaters, and nightclubs in the country and is one of the city’s most vibrant neighborhoods today. U Street was heavily affected by the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and Metro construction in the 1980s also hampered local businesses. Through it all, Ben’s Chili Bowl continued to serve loyal customers and has become a regional icon. From the Metro, head west on U Street to Ben’s for a half-smoke or dine at one of the numerous other restaurants nearby.

    <h2>Lunch: Columbia Heights</h2>
    <p>
        The neighborhood around the Columbia Heights metro has a rich history of immigration, particularly from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Immigrants from these countries sought refuge from civil strife and opportunities in the United States. Today, Latin American restaurants, shops, and festivals are integral parts of the local culture, especially around 14th Street and Park Road. Follow your nose to a Latin American lunch at such places as Corado's Restaurant, Los Hermanos, or Don Julio.
    </p>

    <h2>Afternoon: Archives</h2>
    <p>
        Cross Pennsylvania Avenue and walk a few blocks towards the National Gallery of Art’s East Wing. Designed by I. M. Pei and completed in 1978, the East Wing is famous for its sharp angles, open atriums, and the extensive use of glass and marble. It houses works by artists like Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder, and Roy Lichtenstein, showcasing pieces from the 20th century onwards. Be sure to take a selfie with the “blue chicken,” the informal name given to the sculpture titled "Hahn/Cock" by the German artist Katharina Fritsch.
    </p>

    <h2>Dinner: Waterfront</h2>
    <p>
        From M Street, walk two blocks west toward The Wharf, a major mixed-use redevelopment project that has transformed the city's waterfront along the Potomac River. Spanning more than 3.5 million square feet, The Wharf revitalizes what was once a largely industrial and underutilized area into a neighborhood filled with dining, entertainment, residential, and recreational spaces. It also includes the Maine Avenue Fish Market, the oldest continuously operating open-air fish market in the U.S. Grab some seafood for dinner at Hank’s Oyster Bar or one of the many other eateries nearby.

            <div class="itinerary-content">
    <h2>Breakfast: Huntington</h2>
    <p>
        Fuel up for your day on the Metro at Bob and Edith’s Diner, which is located two blocks south from the Huntington Station and has been family-owned and operated for the past 54 years. Grab a seat in the bright and lively interior for breakfast offered 24 hours a day.
    </p>

    <h2>Morning: L’Enfant Plaza</h2>
    <p>
        Washington’s Metro Stations were designed in the “brutalist” style, known for its stark aesthetic and heavy, exposed concrete. This style was in vogue in the decades after the Cold War and gave rise to buildings such as the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), located on 7th Street across from the Metro. Two different HUD Secretaries, one Democrat, one Republican, have compared it to “ten floors of basement.” From L’Enfant Plaza, head north to Independence Avenue for two additional Brutalist buildings: the Department of Energy and the Hirshhorn Museum of Art.
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch: Mt. Vernon Square</h2>
    <p>
        2016 was a dark year for Democratic politics but a bright one for DC pizza when All Purpose made its debut as the city’s best restaurant, according to the Washington Post. It is still going strong serving Jersey-style pizza and Italian-American antipasti. (From the Metro, head west on M Street then north on 9th Street). After lunch, walk south to the Carnegie Library, across from the Convention Center which is home to the DC History Center. Exhibits include “DC Home Rule 50,” which “explores urgent themes of self-governance, full citizenship, free elections, and DC statehood."
